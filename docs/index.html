I like gardens, trees, and unmechanized farmlands; I smoke a pipe, and like good plain food (unrefrigerated), but detest French cooking; I like, and even dare to wear in these dull days, ornamental waistcoats. I am fond of mushrooms (out of a field); have a very simple sense of humor (which even my appreciative critics find tiresome); I go to bed late and get up late (when possible). I do not travel much."</blockquote><p>Visit our <a href="/Static_Site_Gen/blog">blog posts</a> to read more detailed articles about Middle-earth!</p></div></article>
